User Interaction:

A user submits a query (e.g., add expense, get goal status, fetch stock price, search web).

Agent Core:

The system uses LangChain and LangGraph for agentic reasoning: it interprets the query, classifies the task, and autonomously selects the best resource.

Resource Selection & Execution:

For expense and goal management, it uses MongoDB to store, retrieve, and process transactions or goals.

To fetch live stock information (price/news), it uses external APIs‚ÄîyFinance and AlphaVantage API for market data.

Web search queries utilize a prebuilt tool‚ÄîSerper.dev API‚Äîto fetch real-time information, news, and trending topics.

Results Handling:

The agent integrates responses, formats them, and presents actionable insights or answers back to the user.

üõ† Technology Mapping
Task Type	Tech Used	What It Does
Expense/Goal	MongoDB (database)	Logs, updates, queries transactions and user goals.
Stock Data	yFinance/AlphaVantage	Calls APIs to fetch real-time price, news, analytics.
Web Search	Serper.dev API	Fetches latest news, trending web content.
Agent Core	LangChain/LangGraph	Autonomous reasoning, decision-making, workflow orchestration.
UI/API	Streamlit, FastAPI	Chat/web interface, exposes endpoints for user interaction.
üåü What Makes FinAgent Special
Agentic Intelligence: The core agent autonomously selects and orchestrates tools‚Äîcustom or prebuilt‚Äîaccording to user goals, context, and system state.

Dynamic & Extensible: Modular design lets you add new tools or APIs. The agent adapts, routing tasks and data without hardcoding each function.

Real-World Utility: Covers financial tracking, goal-setting, market analysis, and live information retrieval‚Äîall integrated into one AI-driven system.
