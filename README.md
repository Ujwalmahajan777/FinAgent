Project Functionality (Explained via Workflow)
User Interaction:
Users interact via a web UI or API, submitting natural language queries (like adding expenses, setting goals, checking stock info, or web searches).

Agent Core:

Implemented using LangChain and LangGraph for reasoning and workflow orchestration.

The agent interprets the query, classifies the task, and autonomously selects the correct tool/resource.

Task Routing and Resource Usage:

Expense & Goal Management:
Uses MongoDB for secure, persistent storage and queries.

Stock Market Data:
Fetches real-time prices/news via yFinance and AlphaVantage APIs.

Web Search:
Utilizes the Serper.dev API to search for trending news and information.

Agentic Decider:
The agent selects and orchestrates these tools dynamically‚Äîno hardcoded logic.

Results Handling:

The agent collects responses, formats them, and delivers user-friendly results via the interface.
